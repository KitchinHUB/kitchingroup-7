;;   abstract =	 {The modification of the electronic and chemical properties of
;;                   Pt(111) surfaces by subsurface 3d transition metals was
;;                   studied using density-functional theory. In each case
;;                   investigated, the Pt surface d-band was broadened and lowered
;;                   in energy by interactions with the subsurface 3d metals,
;;                   resulting in weaker dissociative adsorption energies of
;;                   hydrogen and oxygen on these surfaces. The magnitude of the
;;                   decrease in adsorption energy was largest for the early 3d
;;                   transition metals and smallest for the late 3d transition
;;                   metals. In some cases, dissociative adsorption was calculated
;;                   to be endothermic. The surfaces investigated in this study had
;;                   no lateral strain in them, demonstrating that strain is not a
;;                   necessary factor in the modification of bimetallic surface
;;                   properties. The implications of these findings are discussed
;;                   in the context of c talyst design, particularly for fuel cell
;;                   electrocatalysts.  (C) 2004 American Institute of Physics.},
